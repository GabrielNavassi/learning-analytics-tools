# Learning Analytics Tools — Portfolio & Study Log

This repository tracks my **daily practice** and **portfolio** as a _data artisan_ — focusing on
Excel dashboards, Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, and Microsoft Fabric. It is organized so each tool has
its own folder with example files and a short write‑up (README).

> Intent: ship small improvements daily. Commits can be notes, screenshots, or tiny fixes — **consistency fills the green squares.**

## Structure

- `excel-dashboards/` — Excel `.xlsx`/`.xlsm` and a brief README per dashboard.
- `powerbi/` — `.pbix` files + a README with goals, data sources, and screenshots.
- `tableau/` — `.twb/.twbx` workbooks + README, data notes, and design decisions.
- `qlik/` — `.qvf` or load scripts (`.qvs`) + README with data model sketch.
- `fabric/` — Notebooks (`.ipynb`), pipeline JSONs, Lakehouse notes, and usage guides.
- `notebooks/` — General Python/SQL notebooks for prototyping (Colab/Jupyter).
- `assets/screenshots/` — Images for READMEs and portfolio visuals.
- `_templates/` — Markdown templates for new projects and daily logs.

## Quick Start

1. Create a new project using the templates in `_templates/`.
2. Add at least **one screenshot** per project in `assets/screenshots/` and reference it in the README.
3. Commit small & often: `feat(excel): add KPI card layout v1`

## Daily Study Log

Keep a short log in `STUDY_LOG.md` — 3 bullets per day:
- What I studied
- What I practiced
- What I shipped (even tiny)
